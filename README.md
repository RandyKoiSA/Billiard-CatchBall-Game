# Repository Name: Ricochet-Ball-Game
A ball game where you have to click on the ball to gain point. After clicking on the ball the
ball resets but the speed increases slightly. When the ball reaches to the borders of the program, it will
ricochet the wall and continue bouncing but still have the same speed. <br>
